# Tech Titans' Climate Analysis Project

Tech Titans is a team striving to explore climate change. Our team of three enthusiastic members researched, rendered, and analysed data from multiple trusted sources to deliver a web application. This web application brings important details such as rising sea levels, varying pollution, deforestation, and several other factors into light. As a result, we have created a project that brings our analysis and researchwork to encourage awareness of the situation and propose meaningful and valuable solutions.
